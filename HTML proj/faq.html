                <h3>How does a website work?</h3>
                <p>A website works by serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a user's web browser. The browser then interprets these files and renders the content to the user. When a user interacts with the website (e.g., clicks a link or submits a form), the browser sends requests to the web server, which processes the requests and returns the appropriate response.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between front-end and back-end development?</h3>
                <p>Front-end development involves building the user interface and client-side functionality of a website or web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development involves building the server-side logic and database functionality that powers the website or web application.</p>
